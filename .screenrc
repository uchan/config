# /etc/screenrc
#
#   This is the system wide screenrc.
#
#   You can use this file to change the default behavior of screen system wide
#   or copy it to ~/.screenrc and use it as a starting point for your own
#   settings.
#
#   Commands in this file are used to set options, bind screen functions to
#   keys, redefine terminal capabilities, and to automatically establish one or
#   more windows at the beginning of your screen session.
#
#   This is not a comprehensive list of options, look at the screen manual for
#   details on everything that you can put in this file.
